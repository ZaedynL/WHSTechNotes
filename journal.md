Last week we looked at computer science jobs. This week we'll look at applying computer science to jobs in any industry. I'd like you to consider why is learning to code valuable regardless of the industry you choose to work in?

Write a paragraph or more focused on the following:

How can coding improve problem-solving skills?
How might understanding code help you in industries that aren’t directly related to technology, such as healthcare, finance, or education?
How does coding enhance creativity or collaboration?
Provide examples where coding knowledge might benefit professionals in various fields. Remember to use specific examples and reflect on how coding can impact your future career path, even if it’s not directly related to computer science.

You can use the following video to help inform your response: Computer Science is Changing Everything

As a class, we followed the instructions to set up our GitHub journals. However, only a small number of journals were set up in a way that I could access them. Let’s figure out together what went wrong and how we can improve the process.

For Me: What could I have done differently in drafting or explaining the instructions? Were there any parts that were unclear or confusing?
For You: Did you encounter any challenges while following the steps? If so, what were they? What do you think may have been missed or misunderstood?
Please share your thoughts, as we’ll use this feedback to make sure everyone’s journals are properly set up moving forward.
